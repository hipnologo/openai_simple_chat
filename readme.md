# OpenAI Simple Chat
This project demonstrates the use of OpenAI's API to generate text completions in a simple web-based chat application. The application is built using Flask, a micro web framework for Python, and uses the OpenAI API to generate text completions based on a given prompt and topic. 

## Getting Started
To use this application, you will need to sign up for an API key from OpenAI, which you can do [here](https://beta.openai.com/signup/). Once you have an API key, you can set it as an environment variable on your system. 

To run the application, simply clone the repository and run the openai_simple_chat.py file. The application will be available at http://localhost:5000/.

## Using the Application
The application has two main pages: the home page, where you can enter a topic and select a prompt, and the answer page, where the generated text completion will be displayed. The home page also has a form to download the answer as a markdown file.

## Built With
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - A micro web framework for Python
* [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/) - A platform for training and deploying machine learning models
